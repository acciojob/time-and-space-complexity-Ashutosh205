    <h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that describes how the execution time of an algorithm increases as the input size grows. An efficient algorithm has lower time complexity, allowing it to handle larger inputs more effectively.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm needs to execute. It is often expressed in terms of Big-O notation, such as O(n), indicating how memory usage scales with input size.
